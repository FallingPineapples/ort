Description: Takes images, imported via 'imager', and converts them into a data
  frame that can be plotted to look like the imported image.  This can be used 
  for creating data that looks like a specific image. Additionally, images with
  color and alpha channels can be converted to grayscale in preparation for 
  converting to the data frame format.
